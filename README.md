# SoccerSummary
A summarization code platform. It takes in queried minute-by-minute commentary from a PostGres Server and creates a naturally readable summary.
We added features such as identifying domination periods, key chances, and match build-up to enhance match details.

The summary we create is rule based, but we have attempted to train a summarization model (See et Al.) to automatically create our desired summary from discrete commentary as input.
